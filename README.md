# discord-selfbot

Simple Discord selfbot that I will slowly be working on in my spare time consisting of no dependencies or using any third party libraries or code apart from the generic node.js websocket library that I will be incorparating my own version of into this project in the near future. Interacts directly with Discord's api.
